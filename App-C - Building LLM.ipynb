A canine model to investigate the effects of an antiinflammatory agent. The aseptically loosened prosthesis provided a means for investigating the in vivo and in vitro activity of the cells associated with the loosening process in seven dogs. The cells were isolated and maintained in culture for sufficient periods of time so that their biologic activity could be studied as well as the effect of different agents added to the cells in vivo or in vitro. The biologic response as determined by interleukin-1 and prostaglandin E2 activity paralleled the roentgenographic appearance of loosening and the technetium images and observations made at the time of revision surgery. The correlation between clinical, roentgenographic, histologic, and biochemical loosening indicates that the canine model is suitable for investigating the mechanisms of prosthetic failure. A canine model permits the study of possible nonsurgical therapeutic interventions with the ultimate hope of stopping or slowing the loosening process.   \n",

Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is the isoform of enolase, a glycolytic enzyme found in the neuroendocrine system. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a peptide recently discovered in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Serum NSE and plasma NPY levels have been reported to be increased in some patients with pheochromocytoma. The authors evaluated whether the measurement of these molecules could help to discriminate between benign and malignant forms of pheochromocytoma. The NSE levels were normal in all patients with benign pheochromocytoma (n = 13) and elevated in one half of those with malignant pheochromocytoma (n = 13). Plasma NPY levels were on the average significantly higher in the malignant (177.1 +/- 38.9 pmol/l, n = 16) than in the benign forms of the disease (15.7 +/- 389 pmol/l, n = 24). However, there was no difference in the percentage of patients with elevated NPY levels. These results show that determination of serum NSE may be useful for distinguishing between malignant and benign pheochromocytoma; the measurement of plasma NPY is not useful for differentiating the two kinds of tumors.   \n",
       "2  Sexually transmitted diseases of the colon, rectum, and anus. The challenge of the nineties. During the past two decades, an explosive growth in both the prevalence and types of sexually transmitted diseases has occurred. Up to 55 percent of homosexual men with anorectal complaints have gonorrhea; 80 percent of the patients with syphilis are homosexuals. Chlamydia is found in 15 percent of asymptomatic homosexual men, and up to one third of homosexuals have active anorectal herpes simplex virus. In addition, a host of parasites, bacterial, viral, and protozoan are all rampant in the homosexual population. Furthermore, the global epidemic of AIDS has produced a plethora of colorectal manifestations. Acute cytomegalovirus ileocolitis is the most common indication for emergency abdominal surgery in the homosexual AIDS population. Along with cryptosporidia and isospora, the patient may present to the colorectal surgeon with bloody diarrhea and weight loss before the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Other patients may present with colorectal Kaposi's sarcoma or anorectal lymphoma, and consequently will be found to have seropositivity for HIV. However, in addition to these protean manifestations, one third of patients with AIDS consult the colorectal surgeon with either condylomata acuminata, anorectal sepsis, or proctitis before the diagnosis of HIV disease. Although aggressive anorectal surgery is associated with reasonable surgical results in some asymptomatic HIV positive patients, the same procedures in AIDS (symptomatic HIV positive) patients will often be met with disastrous results. It is incumbent upon the surgeon, therefore, to recognize the manifestations of HIV disease and diagnose these conditions accordingly.   \n",

We have identified a lipolytic factor in extracts of a cachexia-inducing murine carcinoma (MAC16) that shows characteristics of an acidic peptide and appears to be composed of three fractions of apparent molecular weights corresponding to 3 kd, 1.5 kd, and 0.7 kd, as determined by exclusion chromatography. Material with identical chromatographic and molecular weight characteristics was also present in the serum of patients with clinical cancer cachexia but absent from normal serum, even under conditions of starvation. The MAC16 lipid factor, when injected into animals bearing the non-cachexia-inducing tumor MAC13, was capable of inducing weight loss without a significant reduction in food intake.

The identification of carotid restenosis as an unexpected late complication of carotid endarterectomy has prompted concerns regarding its importance as a source of new cerebral symptoms, stroke, and death. To investigate these concerns, we analyzed a consecutive series of 507 patients undergoing 566 carotid endarterectomies, each documented as technically satisfactory. Post-operative duplex Doppler examination data at 3 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 months, and annually thereafter in 484 arteries (85.5%) permitted classification of these arteries according to the most severe degree of postoperative stenosis: normal (n = 306); 1% to 19% (n = 89); 20% to 50% (n = 40); more than 50% (n = 49, including 8 occluded). The incidence of more than 50% restenosis was 14.5% in female and 7.7% in male patients (p = 0.003). Life table analyses to 10 years revealed a significantly greater life expectancy among those with restenosis (p = 0.05). Stroke was also less likely in patients with restenosis, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. When survival and stroke were both endpoints, the likelihood of patients with more than 50% restenosis remaining alive and stroke free was also greater than the less than 20% stenotic group (p = 0.03). Thus patients with carotid restenosis were less likely than patients with normal postoperative scans to have late symptoms, stroke, or early death.   "

The aseptically loosened prosthesis provided a means for investigating the in vivo and in vitro activity of the cells associated with the loosening process in seven dogs. The cells were isolated and maintained in culture for sufficient periods of time so that their biologic activity could be studied as well as the effect of different agents added to the cells in vivo or in vitro. The biologic response as determined by interleukin-1 and prostaglandin E2 activity paralleled the roentgenographic appearance of loosening and the technetium images and observations made at the time of revision surgery. The correlation between clinical, roentgenographic, histologic, and biochemical loosening indicates that the canine model is suitable for investigating the mechanisms of prosthetic failure. A canine model permits the study of possible nonsurgical therapeutic interventions with the ultimate hope of stopping or slowing the loosening process.</td>\n",

Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is the isoform of enolase, a glycolytic enzyme found in the neuroendocrine system. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a peptide recently discovered in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Serum NSE and plasma NPY levels have been reported to be increased in some patients with pheochromocytoma. The authors evaluated whether the measurement of these molecules could help to discriminate between benign and malignant forms of pheochromocytoma. The NSE levels were normal in all patients with benign pheochromocytoma (n = 13) and elevated in one half of those with malignant pheochromocytoma (n = 13). Plasma NPY levels were on the average significantly higher in the malignant (177.1 +/- 38.9 pmol/l, n = 16) than in the benign forms of the disease (15.7 +/- 389 pmol/l, n = 24). However, there was no difference in the percentage of patients with elevated NPY levels. These results show that determination of serum NSE may be useful for distinguishing between malignant and benign pheochromocytoma; the measurement of plasma NPY is not useful for differentiating the two kinds of tumors.</td>\n",

During the past two decades, an explosive growth in both the prevalence and types of sexually transmitted diseases has occurred. Up to 55 percent of homosexual men with anorectal complaints have gonorrhea; 80 percent of the patients with syphilis are homosexuals. Chlamydia is found in 15 percent of asymptomatic homosexual men, and up to one third of homosexuals have active anorectal herpes simplex virus. In addition, a host of parasites, bacterial, viral, and protozoan are all rampant in the homosexual population. Furthermore, the global epidemic of AIDS has produced a plethora of colorectal manifestations. Acute cytomegalovirus ileocolitis is the most common indication for emergency abdominal surgery in the homosexual AIDS population. Along with cryptosporidia and isospora, the patient may present to the colorectal surgeon with bloody diarrhea and weight loss before the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Other patients may present with colorectal Kaposi's sarcoma or anorectal lymphoma, and consequently will be found to have seropositivity for HIV. However, in addition to these protean manifestations, one third of patients with AIDS consult the colorectal surgeon with either condylomata acuminata, anorectal sepsis, or proctitis before the diagnosis of HIV disease. Although aggressive anorectal surgery is associated with reasonable surgical results in some asymptomatic HIV positive patients, the same procedures in AIDS (symptomatic HIV positive) patients will often be met with disastrous results. It is incumbent upon the surgeon, therefore, to recognize the manifestations of HIV disease and diagnose these conditions accordingly.</td>\n",

Material with identical chromatographic and molecular weight characteristics was also present in the serum of patients with clinical cancer cachexia but absent from normal serum, even under conditions of starvation. The MAC16 lipid factor, when injected into animals bearing the non-cachexia-inducing tumor MAC13, was capable of inducing weight loss without a significant reduction in food intake.

    "### Transformer Block\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Multi-Head Attention (`self.att`)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** This is where the model learns to \"attend\" to different parts of the input sequence. It calculates relationships between words (or tokens) in the sequence, regardless of their distance. This is crucial for understanding context and long-range dependencies.\n",
    "*   **How it works:**\n",
    "    *   The input `x` is projected into three different representations: **queries (Q)**, **keys (K)**, and **values (V)**.\n",
    "    *   The model calculates **attention scores** by taking the dot product of queries and keys, scaled down by the square root of the key dimension.\n",
    "    *   These scores are passed through a softmax to get **attention weights**, representing the importance of each word to every other word.\n",
    "    *   The attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the values, producing the **context vector**.\n",
    "    *   This process is done multiple times in parallel with different learned projections (**multiple heads**), allowing the model to capture diverse relationships.\n",
    "*   **Why it's important:** Unlike recurrent models (like RNNs), self-attention can process the entire sequence in parallel, making it much faster. It also directly models relationships between any two words, regardless of their position, which helps with long-range dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Feed-Forward (`self.ff`)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** A simple, fully connected feed-forward network that processes each token's representation independently. This adds non-linearity and further transforms the information learned by the attention mechanism.\n",
    "*   **How it works:** Typically, it consists of two linear layers with a non-linear activation function (like GELU or ReLU) in between.\n",
    "*   **Why it's important:** It provides additional processing power and allows the model to learn more complex patterns from the attention outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. LayerNorm (`self.norm1`, `self.norm2`)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** Layer normalization normalizes the activations across the feature dimension (embedding dimension). It helps stabilize training and can improve performance.\n",
    "*   **How it works:** It subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation of the activations within each individual embedding vector (across the embedding dimension).\n",
    "*   **Why it's important:** It prevents the activations from becoming too large or too small, which can lead to unstable gradients during training. It also makes the model less sensitive to the scale of the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Dropout (`self.drop_shortcut`)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** A regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the activations to zero during training. This helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "*   **How it works:** During each forward pass, it randomly \"drops out\" (sets to zero) a certain percentage of the activations, determined by the `drop_rate`.\n",
    "*   **Why it's important:** It forces the model to learn more robust features that are not overly reliant on any single activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Residual Connections (Shortcut Connections)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Purpose:** The output of each sub-block (MHA and FFN) is added to its original input (`x = x + shortcut`). This helps with the flow of gradients during training, especially in deep networks.\n",
    "*   **How it works:** The original input `x` is added to the output of the sub-block before being passed to the next layer.\n",
    "*   **Why it's important:**\n",
    "    *   **Vanishing Gradients:** In very deep networks, gradients can become very small as they are backpropagated through many layers, making training difficult. Residual connections provide a \"shortcut\" for the gradients to flow back, mitigating this problem.\n",
    "    *   **Identity Mapping:** They make it easier for the network to learn the identity function (where the output is the same as the input). This is because if a layer is not needed, the network can easily learn to set its weights to zero, effectively making it pass through the input unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `forward(self, x)` Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward` method defines how the input `x` is processed through the `TransformerBlock`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Attention Block:**\n",
    "    *   Store the original input for the residual connection.\n",
    "    *   Apply layer normalization.\n",
    "    *   Pass through the multi-head attention mechanism.\n",
    "    *   Apply dropout to the output of the attention block\n",
    "    *   Add the original input back (residual connection).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Feed-Forward Block:**\n",
    "    *   Store the output from the attention block for the residual connection.\n",
    "    *   Apply layer normalization.\n",
    "    *   Pass through the feed-forward network.\n",
    "    *   Apply dropout to the output of the feed-forward block.\n",
    "    *   Add the output from the attention block back (residual connection).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Return the processed output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence, the `TransformerBlock` takes an input sequence, allows it to attend to itself, processes it further with a feed-forward network, and uses layer normalization and residual connections to improve training and performance. Multiple `TransformerBlock` instances are stacked together to create the full Transformer model.**\n"

For instance, when creating a poem, high temperature with low Top-k might yield unusual word choices. Conversely, low temperature with high Top-k would produce a more predictable, coherent verse.  In essence, they dictate how \"focused\" versus \"creative\" the generated text becomes."
