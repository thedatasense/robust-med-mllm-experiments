# LLM for Healthcare (llm-healthcare)

This repository contains code and resources related to evaluating and using Large Language Models (LLMs) in the healthcare domain. It includes examples ranging from basic PyTorch implementations to advanced transformer models, robustness experiments with medical images, and guidelines for constructing your own LLMs.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

* **`/src/`**: Core source code
* **`/data/`**: Datasets and metadata
* **`/models/`**: Model implementations organized by model type (Llama, GPT, Gemini, Gemma)
* **`/notebooks/`**: Educational notebooks that demonstrate LLM concepts
* **`/utils/`**: Shared utilities and helper functions
* **`/tests/`**: Test files and sample data
* **`/results/`**: Evaluation results and monitoring statistics
* **`/docs/`**: Documentation and research notes

## Key Features

* **Multimodal Medical Evaluation**: Testing of vision-language models on medical images
* **Robustness Analysis**: Assessment of model performance under various perturbations
* **Performance Monitoring**: Tools to track and analyze model performance metrics
* **Educational Content**: Notebooks explaining LLM fundamentals and implementation
