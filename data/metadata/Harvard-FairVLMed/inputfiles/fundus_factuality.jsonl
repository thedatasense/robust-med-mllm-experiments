{"question_id": 8498, "image": "slo_fundus_08498.jpg", "text": "Is there evidence of retinal pathology in the fundus image?", "answer": "The fundus image does not show any retinal abnormalities; otherwise, these would likely have been noted in the patient's clinical follow-up recommendations."}
{"question_id": 8498, "image": "slo_fundus_08498.jpg", "text": "What does the absence of retinal detachment or hemorrhages in the image suggest about the patient's current retinal health?", "answer": "The absence of retinal detachment or hemorrhages in the fundus image suggests that the patient's retina was intact and healthy at the time the image was taken."}
{"question_id": 8498, "image": "slo_fundus_08498.jpg", "text": "What can be deduced about the blood vessel appearance in the fundus image?", "answer": "Since there is no mention of vascular abnormalities, the blood vessels in the fundus image likely present a normal caliber and course, with no signs of occlusion or significant tortuosity."}
