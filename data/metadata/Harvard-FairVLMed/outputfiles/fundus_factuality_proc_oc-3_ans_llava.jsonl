In this case, the fundus photograph shows a choroidal lesion in the right eye. The choroid is a layer of blood vessels and connective tissue between the retina and the sclera (the white outer layer of the eye). A choroidal lesion can be caused by various factors, such as inflammation, infection, or a growth. Further evaluation and tests may be needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate treatment for the lesion."}
